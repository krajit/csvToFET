# Automate timetable creation using python and FET

## DONE
- Classes in different days have same timings.
- Classes in different days have same room
- Division of major into subgroups based on choices of minors
- Minor subgroup added in the 'compulsory' minor courses.
- Thursday 12-1 break time

## In progress
- Minor subgroups for electives. This step should be done manually. 


## TODO

- Adjust for CCC courses
    - Make groups of first and second year students

- Lunch hour for everyone
- Add compactness constraint (minimal gaps) for students
- Add compactness constraint (minimal gaps) for faculty
- Make ajustments in the room allottment so that large class gets big rooms.


## Notes:
- Seems like major electives are treated as Compulsory for time-tabling purpose. Can this be relaxed? Lets leave it for now.
- Treat minor-electives as same as UWE for time-tabling purpose.
- UWE which are not part of minors, needs to provide a target audience for their course. Else, how about randomly mapping from students doing minors as target audience.
